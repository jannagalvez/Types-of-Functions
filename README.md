# Types-of-Functions

# Overview
An ERC20 token is implemented by the Solidity smart contract MyToken. By adding functions like minting, burning, and ownership control, it expands the capabilities of the ERC20 standard token.

# Usage
- Deployment: Deploy the MyToken contract, which includes the token's name, symbol, and initial supply, to a blockchain network that is compatible with Ethereum.
- Minting: By using the mint function and providing the recipient account and the quantity of tokens to be minted, the contract owner can create new tokens.
- Burning: By using the burn function and passing in the desired quantity of tokens to burn, token holders can burn their own tokens.
- Transfers: By calling the transfer function and providing the recipient address and the quantity of tokens to be transferred, token holders can send tokens to different addresses.
- Allowance and TransferFrom: Token holders can use the approve function to authorize a different address to transfer tokens on their behalf.
The transferFrom function can then be used by the approved address to move tokens from the token holder's account to another address.
